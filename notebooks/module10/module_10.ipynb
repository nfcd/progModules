    "- In this exercise we want to apply signal processing techniques (i.e filtering) to a signal and create plots before and after singal processing to demonstrate noise reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first thing you should do is to find a dataset online or generate your own synthetic data.\n",
    "    - You can generate synthetic data like this:\n",
    "    \n",
    "<code>\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "time = np.linspace(0, 10, 1000)       \n",
    "signal =  np.sin(2*np.pi*1*time) + 0.5 *np.random.randn(1000) \n",
    "</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "(This code generates a noisy signal by adding random noise to a sine wave with a frequency of 1 Hz. The result is stored in the variable <code>signal</code>, which can be used to showcase signal processing techniques like filtering.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Import or read the signal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Plot the noisy signal\n",

    "4. Signal processing(choose the filtering technique).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Ideas and tips: \n",
    "    * Moving average filter: np.convolve()\n",
    "    - The moving average filter smooths a signal by averaging neighboring data points. It's simple to implement and effective for reducing high-frequency noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Apply filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Plot both the filtered and the original signal for comparison. "

    "### Objective:\n",
    "Determine the velocity of the P-wave (primary wave) that traveled from an earthquake's epicenter to a specific seismic station.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Steps:\n",
    "1. **Data Retrieval:** Acquire the event (earthquake) and station data from the IRIS data center.\n",
    "2. **Visualization:** Display a seismogram with the ability to select the P-wave arrival time.\n",
    "3. **Velocity Calculation:** Use the observed P-wave arrival time and the epicentral distance to calculate the P-wave velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Details:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Event (Earthquake) Information:**\n",
    "  - **Location**: 2010 M. 8.8 Maule earthquake, off the coast of central Chile.\n",
    "  - **Date and Time**: 27th February 2010, 06:34:11 (UTC).\n",
    "  - **Magnitude**: We've set a threshold for the event magnitude as being greater than 8 to identify this significant earthquake.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Seismic Station Information:**\n",
    "  - **Network**: IU (International)\n",
    "  - **Station Code**: ANMO\n",
    "  - **Location**: Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the Code Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Acquisition:**\n",
    "   - Using the `obspy` library, we connect to the IRIS data center to fetch the details of the specific earthquake and the seismic station.\n",
    "   - We retrieve a seismogram, which is a time-series data that represents the shaking observed at the seismic station for a specific duration around the event time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Visualization:**\n",
    "   - We visualize the seismogram with an adjustable red line to identify the P-wave arrival time.\n",
    "   - The interactive slider allows you to adjust the red line to the point in the seismogram where you identify the first major arrival, which typically corresponds to the P-wave.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Epicentral Distance Calculation:**\n",
    "   - We compute the distance (in degrees) between the earthquake's epicenter and the seismic station using the provided coordinates.\n",
    "   - This distance is crucial for determining how far the seismic waves traveled to get to the station from the earthquake.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Velocity Calculation:**\n",
    "   - After determining the observed P-wave arrival time using the interactive seismogram, we calculate the time taken for the P-wave to travel from the earthquake's epicenter to the seismic station.\n",
    "   - Using the known epicentral distance (converted to meters) and the observed travel time, we compute the P-wave velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this procedure, the code offers a practical way to study seismic wave velocities using real-world data and helps understand how fast seismic waves propagate through the interior of the Earth."

    "### What is `ipywidgets`?\n",
    " - **Interactive Widgets**: `ipywidgets` provides a wide array of widgets including sliders, text boxes, buttons, and many others. These widgets allow users to interact with Python code running in the background, changing variables and seeing the results in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Integration with Jupyter Notebook**: The library is specifically designed to work well within Jupyter notebooks, making it easy to add interactive elements to your data analyses and visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Bidirectional Communication**: The widgets enable bidirectional communication between the Python code and the user interface. This means that you can not only use widgets to change variables in your Python code, but also update widgets based on the results of Python code execution.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Custom Widgets**: While `ipywidgets` provides a wide array of built-in widgets, it also allows you to create custom widgets if the built-in options do not meet your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Versatility**: The widgets can be used for a variety of tasks, including adjusting parameters for data visualizations, providing input for computational tools, and creating interactive demonstrations of algorithms and concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Does it Work?\n",
    "When you create a widget in a Jupyter notebook, it displays a user interface element (such as a slider) directly in the notebook. When you interact with that widget (for example, by moving the slider), a message is sent to the Python kernel running the notebook. The Python code then executes any associated callback functions or updates, and can send messages back to update the widget's state or other output in the notebook."
